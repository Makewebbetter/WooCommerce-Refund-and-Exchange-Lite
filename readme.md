**1) Dedicated refund system**
With our Return Refund and Exchange plugin, merchants can create a dedicated refund system where they can build an email template to send to the customers who ask for a refund. Merchants can add the name, email, email header, and footer for their email template.

**2) Predefined Refund Reason**
Merchants can add multiple reasons for a product refund. Customers can select any of these reasons while asking for a refund with the help of Warranties & Returns For WooCommerce.

With our Refund and Exchange plugin, merchants can handle the tax on the refund products easily. They can simply enable or disable the tax calculation on the refund products by going to the plugin settings and enabling the “Enable Tax” option.

Our Refund management plugin provides a feature to manage stock. Merchants need to enable this feature from the plugin settings. Once you enable this feature, the product stock will be increased whenever a refund request is accepted.

**6) Refund on selected order status**
You can select the order status on which a customer can submit a refund request. You can select either a single or multiple order status in this setting. For example, if you select Completed, and Failed order statuses, you’ll allow your customers to generate a refund request if their order is completed, or failed.
